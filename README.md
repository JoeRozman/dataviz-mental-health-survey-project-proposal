# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullahashfaqvirk/student-mental-health-survey), a mental health survey dataset which contains data from a multitude of different universities via a survey.


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * I want to see the correlation with academic workload and
  social relationships
 * I want to see the correlation with academic pressure and
  depression
 * I want to see the correlation with academic year and
  future insecurity
 * I want to see the distribution of majors to academic
  pressure
 * I want to see the correlation with university and academic
  pressure

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a pie chart and it shows the general structure of how I want the pie chart to look for each of the academic years based on what attribute the user wants to visualize

The Vizhub for this chart can be found [here](https://vizhub.com/JoeRozman/338ba401e2b2473a87139a0ccb65dc66?edit=files&file=README.md&tabs=index.js%7EREADME.md)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
